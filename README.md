A Diaosi's road to Succeed. or Di's road to Succeed. 

### Day 1: 03/17/2016
Run 5.5km @ Lake Johnson. Wasted a lot of time cooking... 
Ordered Soylent again, the third time. Seems hard to say goodbye to her...

BFS: Use Queue. In Python, use [].popleft as deque
Failed when interviewed by Alibaba. T_T so depressed.
- [287@LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/) 
- Basic Quick Sort Algorithm 



### Day 2: 03/18/2016
Spending so much time to practice bug-free Quick Sort...

I may have to write the sort functions every few days just to keep the sharpness of writing basic algorithms.

- finish the coding for post-processing and statistics part.
- Coding on Spark.
Enter the 30%+ Easy Zone.  Great to see so many totally different solutions even for a very simple question!  Human ia an amazing animal!!!  Powerful of the mind.  Keep going!

### Day 3: 03/19/2016
Not so efficient today. Get 6 LeetCode done. 

Reviewed slides again for CSC522. Ready to finish HW3.

Has to begin coding on Email Signature stuff tomorrow. Do some HW if possible.

There is a lot of things to to done in the next 2 or 3 days...
 - Mark Emails within the Signature Block.
 - HW3 for CSC522
 - Code for Multi-lable classifier for CSC510
 - Spark code to predict labels for StackOverFlow.(CSC522 project)
 - Prepare Presentation for Basic Data Mining Tasks.

oh... just kill me! Do I need some sleep or some coffee?

### Day 4: 03/20/2016
What a fruitless day... Spending all day at lab without completing anything.
 - Learned the Floyd's Detection Algorithm. It's really a powerful and widely application algorithm.
 - Add job title, company name, address feature to talon, proved improvement in precision, while decreasement in recall. In general, the f-score decrease from 0.7 to 0.5. 
 - Also fixed several bugs in the code.
 - [ ] need to mark the emails again, and write to extraction code.
 - [ ] need some time to finish hw3 for csc522. Mid-term is around the corner.

oh, Apple is going to release new products 7 hours later. Luckly, I haven't got enough money to upgrade my laptop. Tools matters though, your willingness matters more.

### Day 5: 03/21/2016   22/338
 
 - [********50%----------] of hw3 done.
 - run around lake
 - 5 done.

Wasted more than 2 hours cooking and watching the Most Smart Brain... I should use this time coding new stuff, reading textbooks, papers.  I have to set serveral rules for myself. That is a must to challenge myself and push me forward to a totally new level.

> Rule 1: Stop wasting your life on the entertainment videos.

> Rule 2: Reduce time spending on Social Networks. The less the better.

> Rule 3: Get rid of the illusions that buying some fancy things will make my life much better. 

> Rule 4: Always prepare for the worst, but working for the best. (This may to too abstract... but, it looks so good. Anyway, I'd put it here.) 

> Rule 5: DO NOT just make rules, and then let them hang there, sleep, and die.

Another update about my life. Restart drinking coffee again. It's a good sign for me. I am exploring my potentials again. Good night, Jack.

- [x] pre-processor for detailed information extraction from emails.

### Day 7: 23/03/2016 27/338
A big news today, after the last big news 7 days ago. I get the funding to be paid to work in our lab. It means I do not need to find a internship this summer, but it does not mean I will stop practicing coding here on leetcode, neither does it mean I will become lazy or unabious wasting time on meanless things.
